# React Js and React Native Challenge

  Hey, thanks for your interest in working with us. Before we continue your application we need to check if you can handle some skilss.
  We know that's boring and it sucks, but it allow us to create a team that really can collaborate. 
  
  So if you are here, we need to check some of your skills ok? Let's do It!
  
# What are we looking for?
  
  First, we need you to know that you have a domain of Javascript and ReactJs/React Native. It's important to remember that our entire culture is based on Clean Code, so, be aware that we will expect that your code is well written and well documented, ok?
  
  -  **ReactJs** </br>
   If you are applying for a Reactjs role, we expect you to use SASS for styling your app.
   
  - **React Native**</br>
   If you are applying for a React Native role, we expect you to use Styled Component for styling your app. 
   You are not allowed to use EXPO!

  - **Storage**</br>
   It's required to use Redux, using hooks, and using Thunk as an async middleware.

  - **Tests**</br>
   You must implement some tests in your application. Those tests should run when the command `npm test` is prompted.
    We recommend you to use jest and maybe cypress. (Be free to use whatever you like).

# Your Goal
 
  Your goal here is to create a simple application that will be a Trivia Game. 
  
 Your game must receive from an external API 10 true/false questions, present those questions for users, store users' answers and then show the result of the end game.
 
  We want to see how you structure your code and the solutions you use to each challenge you will face.

# Api

You must use https://opentdb.com/ as API for getting the trivia questions. Be aware that the documentation for using this API is in the provided link and that you need to receive 10 questions for each request, these questions should only be true/false and have a pre-setted difficulty.

# Screens

Your application must have at least 3 basic screens:

1) Start Game Screen

```

# UI/UX

 Be free to give your style to the project, use your imagination, we won't review it but it would be great if the application has some care in the design.
 
# How to apply your code

 When your task is done please create a repo inside your Github account, this repo must be public. Send the repo URL via e-mail to tech@getpingback.com.
 
 # How your code will be reviewed.
 
  If you are using Reactjs you application must build and run server. If you are using React Native your application must run MetroJs and work with Android or IOS Simulator (IOS is better).
  
  The application code will be reviewed keeping the following criterias:

 - Functionality
 - Project Structure
 - Maintainability
 - Use of best practices
 - Domain of Javascript
